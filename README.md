## Tuts+ Course: Building iOS Apps In C# With Xamarin
### Instructor: Derek Jensen

Xamarin is changing the way we write mobile applications. If you're a C# developer looking to get into the world of mobile, you can easily get started without having to learn new languages and IDEs. Xamarin allows you to write mobile applications that target multiple platforms in a single language using tools you're already comfortable with. In a previous course on Tuts+ we looked at Building Android Apps in C# With Xamarin. In this course you'll learn all you need to know to get started building iOS Apps. Let's do it!
